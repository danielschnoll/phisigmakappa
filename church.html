					<p>The Gamma Tetarton Chapter of Phi Sigma Kappa was founded on October 14, 1950. We are known as the very first fraternity in the country to ever 
						purchase and live in a church, hence our "Church" nickname. We boast not only the largest physical chapter house on campus, but one of the 
						largest fraternity houses in the country. We own both the Church and the rectory next door, and can house up to 30 brothers at max occupancy.</p>
					<p>Before this beautiful historic building became our home, it was formerly known as the Saint Francis De Sales Parish. The church was originally built in 1876. 
						<!--< more church history here >. 
						< more images and description of the building >-->
						The St. Francis DeSales church closed its doors on February 1, 2009. The Gamma Tetarton Chapter completed the purchase of both the Church and Rectory
						properties on February 4, 2011.</p>
					<p>Since our moving into the Church, we have seen our chapter grow and prosper immensely. We achieved the highest campus GPA in 2014 and 2015. We also 
						have launched several service projects, including the Mt. Ida Micro Grant Program and Phi Sig Frydays. We hope to continue growing the chapter for years to come!</p>
